# Bracketeer

Bracketeer gives you brackets and quotes superpowers at the tip of your fingers. Easily swap bracket/quote types, remove them or select their content from within with one command. No need to select content of the bracket/quote or move your cursor. Works even on multiple selections.

Extension should work with different languages, but if you encounter error, please let know and I will try to fix it.

Feedback and PRs are welcome. Enjoy the plugin.

## Features

Bracketeer currently provide four commands to manipulate with brackets and their equivalents for quotes. All commands work on multiple selections as well.

### Brackets

#### Swap brackets/Replace brackets with...

_Swap brackets_: `Shift+Cmd+Alt+K`
_Replace brackets with..._: `Shift+Cmd+Alt+U`

This command allows you to switch to different bracket types from within the brackets without need to select them. You can either cycle through them or use Quick pick menu to select correct bracket immediately.

#### Remove brackets

Keyboard shortcut: `Shift+Cmd+Alt+I`

This command will delete closest brackets

![Delete brackets](images/bracket_delete.gif)

#### Select brackets content

Keyboard shortcut: `Shift+Cmd+Alt+H`

With the help of this command you can easily select content of the brackets, Calling this command again will select brackets as well. This can be chained to select outer brackets (and perform some actions on them).

### Quotes

#### Swap quotes/Replace quotes with...

_Swap quotes_: `Shift+Cmd+Alt+;`
_Replace quotes with..._: not assigned by default

This command allows you to switch to different quote types from within the quotes without need to select them. You can either cycle through them or use Quick pick menu to select correct quote type immediately.

#### Select quotes content

Keyboard shortcut: `Shift+Cmd+Alt+Â¨`

With the help of this command you can easily select content of the quotes, Calling this command again will select quotes as well. Unlike bracket alternative, selection won't expand more after selection of the quotes.

## Known Issues

- In case of switching quotes from multiline template literal to simple string the result will be invalid string (especially with variable interpolation). So the next quotes switching won't work and Bracketeer will fail. There is not an easy way how to fix it. So please keep that in mind.
- When parsing quotes there may be some edge cases in string heavy documents with long multiline string when wrong quotes will be parsed. I plan to look into it and find a way how to minimize or remove this issue.


## Road map

- Selection from cursor to opening/closing bracket/quote
- Cursor navigation to opening/closing brackets/quotes
- Language specific settings for bracket/quotes types available for swapping
- Add Flowtype support, code polishing, better build flow
- Add settings to specify how large line offset should be used for quotes parsing (default is 8)
- Refactor token cycling - it is just a bunch of ifs now, it should be universal function for easy extensibility
